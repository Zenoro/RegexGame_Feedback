		"Digits <color=#3c3cff>1-6</color>: Address code  ",
		"Digits <color=#e06600>7-14</color>: Date of birth code  ",

		"Based on common knowledge, we can summarize the following validation rules:  ",
		"1. A year has 12 months, so the month value must be between 1~12.  ",
		"2. Each month has 29, 30, or 31 days, so the day value must be between 1~31.  ",
		"3. The first two digits of the year should be 19 or 20.  ",
		"4. The total length must be 18 characters (or 17 digits + X).  ",
		"5. The check digit must be a numeric digit or uppercase letter X.  ",
		"",
		"To simplify calculations, we adopt the following conventions:  ",
		"1. Do not validate the exact number of days in a specific month. Year, month, and day components are validated separately. For example, although February has no 30th, an input like 19990230 will still match successfully.  ",
		"2. The address code and sequence code are only verified as numeric digits, with no additional checks.  ",
